Final Project

Files in this project: Game.py
		       Ascii.py
		       Room.py
		       Fight.py

These files require permission to run, so run chmod u+x [filename] on each of them in the command line prior to running.
To run this game after you have set permissions, type "python Game.py" in the command line.
Python requires quotation marks around its strings, so for your options, type "option" instead of option, otherwise it will error.
